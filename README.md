# ODataStringToExpression
**ODataStringToExpression** is a C# library that converts OData query filter syntax in string format to Linq Expressions. It is designed to work with generic datatypes and generates Linq expressions based on the input datatype. 

The library is built on top of the .NET Standard 2.0 framework and can be used in any .NET application that supports this framework. 

Here's an example of how to use the library:

```csharp
using ODataStringToExpression;
using System.Linq.Expressions;

// Define a sample class
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

// Create an instance of the ODataToExpression class
var odataToExpression = new ODataToExpression<Person>();

// Define an OData filter expression as a string
string filter = "Age gt 30";

// Convert the filter expression to a Linq expression
Func<Person, bool> predicate = odataToExpression.Convert(filter);

// Use the Linq expression to filter a collection of Person objects
List<Person> people = new List<Person>
{
    new Person { Name = "Alice", Age = 25 },
    new Person { Name = "Bob", Age = 35 },
    new Person { Name = "Charlie", Age = 45 }
};

var filteredPeople = people.Where(predicate);

// The filteredPeople collection now contains two elements: Bob and Charlie
```

Using **ODataStringToExpression**, you can easily convert OData query filter syntax in string format to Linq Expressions, which can then be used to filter collections of objects. This can save you time and effort when working with large datasets.
